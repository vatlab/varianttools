[FilterStatus]
index=7
type=VARCHAR(25)
comment=A machine-learning technique called support vector machine (SVM) classification was applied for variant filtering. After the initial SNP calls were generated, we re-examined the BAM files to collect additional information about each variant site. Based on the information, variants are initially filtered by individual thresholds. For example, variants with posterior probability <99% (glfMultiples SNP quality <20), were <5bp away from an indel detected in the 1000 Genomes Pilot Project, had total depth across samples of <5,379 or >5,379,000 reads (~1-1000 reads per sample), having >65% of reads as heterozygotes carrying the variant allele or where the absolute squared correlation between allele (variant or reference) and strand (forward or reverse) was >0.15 were marked as problematic SNPs. Sites failed 3 or more criteria are used as negative examples to train SVM classifier. HapMap3 and OMNI polymorphic sites were used as positive examples. The SVM classifier produces scores for each site, and we marked ~8.5% of sites at threshold 0.3 as SVM filter-failed. The unfiltered set had Ti/Tv = 2.63, and the filtered set had Ti/Tv =2.78.
