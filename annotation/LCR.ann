[data sources]
anno_type=range
description=Low Complexity, repeat and other regions identified by RepeatMasker. RepeatMasker was run with the -s (sensitive) setting. Using: Jan 29 2009 (open-3-2-7) version of RepeatMasker and RELEASE 20090120 of library RepeatMaskerLib.embl
delimiter=None
header=2
version=hg19_20090320

source_type=txt
source_pattern=fa.out

[SW_score]
index=1
type=INTEGER
comment=Smith-Waterman score of the match, usually complexity adjusted
        The SW scores are not always directly comparable. Sometimes
        the complexity adjustment has been turned off, and a variety of
        scoring-matrices are used.

[perc_div]
index=2
type=FLOAT
comment=%% substitutions in matching region compared to the consensus

[perc_del]
index=3
type=FLOAT
comment=%% of bases opposite a gap in the query sequence (deleted bp)

[perc_ins]
index=4
type=FLOAT
comment=%% of bases opposite a gap in the repeat consensus (inserted bp)

[chr]
index=5
adj=RemoveLeading('chr')
type=VARCHAR(20)
comment=Name of query sequence (chromosome)

[pos_begin]
index=6
type=INTEGER
adj=IncreaseBy(1)
comment=starting position of match in query sequence

[pos_end]
index=7
type=INTEGER
comment=ending position of match in query sequence

[pos_left]
index=8
type=INTEGER
adj=lambda x: ('-' + x[1:-1]) if x.startswith('(') else x
comment=no. of bases in query sequence past the ending position of match
	Negative number (-XXX) is stored for number in parenthesis (XXX) in the output.

[matching_repeat]
index=9
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=If C, match is with the Complement of the consensus sequence in the database

[repeat_name]
index=10
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=name of the matching interspersed repeat

[repeat_class]
index=11
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=the class of the repeat, in this case a DNA transposon 
            fossil of the MER2 group (see below for list and references)

[repeat_begin]
index=12
type=VARCHAR(255)
#  this is not right because some recrods show (-2642), I do not know
#  what it means
comment=starting position of match in database sequence (using top-strand numbering)
	It is saved as string because I do not under what is the meaning of the parenthesis
	(I see (-2642), (0), (123) etc)

[repeat_end]
index=13
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=ending position of match in database sequence
	It is saved as string because I do not under what is the meaning of the parenthesis
	(I see (-2642), (0), (123) etc)

[repeat_left]
index=14
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=no. of bases in (complement of) the repeat consensus sequence 
    prior to beginning of the match (so 0 means that the match extended 
    all the way to the end of the repeat consensus sequence)
	It is saved as string because I do not under what is the meaning of the parenthesis
	(I see (-2642), (0), (123) etc)

[mask_id]
index=15
type=INTEGER
comment=ID of the mask
