* A README file.

* A MacOS X installer that installs variant tools apps to system Applications
  directory and commands vtools and vtools_report to /usr/local/bin. It
  requires root privilege.

* Two self-contained executables vtools and vtools_report that can be executed
  directly without installation. These commands start slower than the installed
  version and are not recommended for general use.
