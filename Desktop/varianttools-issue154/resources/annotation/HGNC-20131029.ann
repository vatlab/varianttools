description=The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) has assigned unique gene symbols
	and names to almost 38,000 human loci, of which around 19,000 are protein coding.
	genenames.org is a curated online repository of HGNC-approved gene nomenclature and
	associated resources including links to genomic, proteomic and phenotypic information,
	as well as dedicated gene family pages

[Approved_Name]
index=3
type=VARCHAR(255)

[Locus_Group]
index=6
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Groups locus types together into related sets. See http://www.genenames.org/data/gdlw_columndef.html#gd_app_sym for details.

Many genes receive approved symbols and names which are viewed as temporary (eg C2orf#) or are non-ideal when considered in the light of subsequent information. In the case of individual genes a change to the name (and subsequently the symbol) is only made if the original name is seriously misleading.

Families/groups may be either structural or functional, therefore a gene may belong to more than one family/group. These tags are used to generate gene family or grouping specific pages at genenames.org and do not necessarily reflect an official nomenclature. Each gene family has an associated gene family tag and gene family description. If a particular gene is a member of more than one gene family, the tags and the descriptions will be shown in the same order.

[Gene_family_description]
index=26
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Name given to a particular gene family. The gene family description has an associated gene family tag. Gene families are used to group genes according to either sequence similarity or information from publications, specialist advisors for that family or other databases.
