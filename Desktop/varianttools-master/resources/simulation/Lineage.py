        '''Counting **backward in time**, this model evolves a population for ``T0``
        generations (required parameter). The ancient population ``A`` started at
        size ``N_A`` and expanded at ``T_AF`` generations from now, to pop ``AF``
        with size ``N_AF``. Pop ``B`` split from pop ``AF`` at ``T_B`` generations
        from now, with size ``N_B``; Pop ``AF`` remains as ``N_AF`` individuals.
        Pop ``EU`` and  ``AS`` split from pop ``B`` at ``T_EU_AS`` generations
        from now; with size ``N_EU0`` individuals and ``N_ASO`` individuals,
        respectively. Pop ``EU`` grew exponentially with rate ``r_EU``; Pop
        ``AS`` grew exponentially with rate ``r_AS``. The ``YRI``, ``CEU`` and
        ``CHB`` samples are drawn from ``AF``, ``EU`` and ``AS`` populations
        respectively. Additional operators could be added to ``ops``. Information
        fields required by these operators should be passed to ``infoFields``. If
        a scaling factor ``scale`` is specified, all population sizes and
        generation numbers will be divided by a factor of ``scale``.

        This model merges all subpopulations if it is applied to a population with
        multiple subpopulation.
