description=dbscSNV includes all potential human SNVs within splicing consensus regions (-3 to +8 at the 5' splice site and -12 to +2 at the 3' splice site), i.e. scSNVs, related functional annotations and two ensemble prediction scores for predicting their potential of altering splicing.

index=17
type=FLOAT NULL
adj=Nullify('.')
comment=ensemble prediction score based on ada-boost. Ranges 0 to 1. The larger the score the higher probability the scSNV will affect splicing. The suggested cutoff for a binary prediction (affecting splicing vs. not affecting splicing) is 0.6.

adj=Nullify('.')
comment=ensemble prediction score based on random forests. Ranges 0 to 1. The larger the score the higher probability the scSNV will affect splicing. The suggested cutoff for a binary prediction (affecting splicing vs. not affecting splicing) is 0.6.
