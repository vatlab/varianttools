[format description]
description=Input format illumina indels.txt file, created by CASAVA version 1.8 (http://www.illumina.com/support/documentation.ilmn). This format imports chr, pos, ref, alt of most likely genotype, and a Q score for the most likely genotype.
variant=seq_name, pos, ref, alt
genotype=%(geno)s
genotype_info=%(geno_info)s

[DEFAULT]
geno=max_g_type
geno_info=Q_indel

[seq_name]
index=1
type=VARCHAR(20)
adj=RemoveLeading('chr')
comment=Reference sequence label

[pos]
index=2
type=INTEGER NOT NULL
comment=Start position of the indel event. Except for right-side breakpoints, the reported position is the first (left-most) reference position following the indel breakpoint. For right-side breakpoints the reported position is the right-most position preceding the breakpoint. Also note that wherever the same indel could be represented in a range of locations, the caller attempts to report it in the 'left-most' position possible.

[type]
index=3
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=String summarizing the indel type. One of: nI - insertion of length n (e.g. 10I is a 10 base insertion) nD - deletion of length n (e.g. 10D is a 10 base deletion) BP_LEFT - left-side breakpoint BP_RIGHT - right-side breakpoint

[ref_upsream]
index=4
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Segment of the reference sequence 5' of the indel event. For right- side breakpoints this field is set to the value 'N/A'.

[ref_indel]
index=5
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Equal length sequences corresponding to the reference and indel cases which span the indel event. The character '-' indicates a gap in the reference or indel sequence.

[ref]
index=5
adj=ExtractField(1, '/'), lambda x: '-' if x.startswith('-') else x
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Reference allele, '-' for insertion

[alt]
index=5
# the field has multiple - (eg. ---/CTT)
adj=ExtractField(2, '/'), lambda x: '-' if x.startswith('-') else x
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Alternative allele, '-' for deletion


[ref_downstream]
index=6
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Segment of the reference sequence 3' of the indel event. For left-side breakpoints this field is set to the value 'N/A'.

[Q_indel]
index=7
type=INT
comment=Phred scaled quality score of the indel1 By default the variant caller reports all indels with Q(indel) > 0.

[max_g_type]
index=8
adj=MapValue({'het': '1', 'hom': '2', 'ref': '0'})
type=INT
comment=Most probable indel genotype {het,hom,ref}. The genotype 'hom' refers to a homozygous indel, 'het' refers to a heterozygous indel and 'ref' refers to no indel at this position. The 'ref' state will only be observed in the indel output file as the second most probable genotype, were this state found to be the most probable genotype the candidate indel would not be reported.

[Q_max_gtype]
index=9
type=INT
comment=Phred scaled quality score of the most probable indel genotype1

[depth]
index=10
type=INT
comment=Except for right-side breakpoints, this field reports the depth of the position preceding the left-most indel breakpoint. For right-side breakpoints this is the depth of the position following the breakpoint.

[alt_reads]
index=11
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Number of reads strongly supporting either the reference path or an alternate indel path3

[indel_reads]
index=12
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Number of reads strongly supporting the indel path3

[other_reads]
index=13
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Number of reads intersecting the indel, but not strongly supporting either the reference or any one indel path3

[repeat_unit]
index=14
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=The smallest repeating sequence unit within the inserted or deleted sequence. For breakpoints this field is set to the value 'N/A'.

[ref_repeat_count]
index=15
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Number of times the repeat_unit sequence is contiguously repeated starting from the indel start position in the reference case.

[indel_repeat_count]
index=16
type=VARCHAR(255)
comment=Number of times the repeat_unit sequence is contiguously repeated starting from the indel start position in the indel case.
